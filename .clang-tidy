# Which checks are disabled and why?
# - Disable project-specific checks (abseil, fuchsia, goolge, zircon, llvm)
# - Also disable modernization to trailing return types because this would cause a lot of unnecessary
#   refactoring
# - Implicit conversions sometimes make the code more readable
Checks:          '*,-abseil-*,-fuchsia-*,-google-*,-zircon-*,-llvm*,-modernize-use-trailing-return-type,-readability-implicit-conversion'
