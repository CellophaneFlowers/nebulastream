Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use Slack for that, or you may want to start a discussion during the NES Day.

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

### When reporting a bug, please be sure to include the following:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] An *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior (example: GitHub repository with code isolated to the issue that anyone can clone to observe the problem)
- [ ] What platform(s) you're running it on
- [ ] What OS other dependencies you're using
- [ ] The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

### When you open an issue for a feature request, please add as much detail as possible:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution (link design document, if available)
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better
