This folder contains classes generated by ANTLR for parsing NebulaSQL queries.
Thus, please do not modify these files as it cause additional maintenance overhead when updating the grammar.
To regenerate the ANTLR classes, e.g., upon modifying the ANTLR grammar, you can either use the plugin
provided by CLion or follow the instructions given here: "https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-antlr-cpp/".
The generation of an ANTLR visitor is not required by the current state of NES.

ANTLR automatically puts both the header and source files in the same folder, and therefore, it is
needed to manually move the header files here.
Some of the functions inside the generated files contains the argument "_localctx" but never used it.
This creates errors upon execution while using CLion.
