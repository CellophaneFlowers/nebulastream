/**
 * @brief Implements a lock free watermark processor for a single origin.
 * It processes all watermark updates from one specific origin and applies all updates in sequential order.
 * @assumptions This watermark processor assumes strictly monotonic update sequence numbers.
 * @assumption This watermark processor maintains a fixed size log of inflight watermark updates.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 * This watermark processor stores in flight updates in a fixed size log, implemented with a cycling buffer.
 * We differentiate two cases:
 *
 * 1. If the sequenceNumber of the watermark updates is the next expected sequence number, i.e., currentWatermarkTuple.sequenceNumber + 1.
 * In this case we can update the currentWatermarkTuple as we received the next update.
 * To this end, we first iterate over the log and apply all updates as log as the sequence number is as expected.
 *
 * 2. If the sequenceNumber is different then the next expected sequence number.
 * In this case, we can't update the currentWatermarkTuple.
 * Instead, we store the update in the correct log position.
 *
 * @tparam logSize
