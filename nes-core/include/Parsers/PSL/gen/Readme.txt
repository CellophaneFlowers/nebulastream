This folder contains the classes generated by ANTLR.
To regenerate the ANTLR classes, e.g., upon modifying the ANTLR grammar, you can either use the plugin
provided by CLion or follow the instructions given here: "https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-antlr-cpp/".
The generation of an ANTLR visitor is not required by the current state of NES.

ANTLR automatically puts both the header and source files in "nes-core/src/Parsers/NePSL/gen", and therefore, it is
needed to manually move the header files here: "nes-core/include/Parsers/NePSL/gen".
