 * @brief This class is used for operator placement on the path with low link latency between sources and destination.
 * Also, the operators are places such that the overall query latency will be as low as possible.
 *
 * Following are the rules used:
 *
 * Path Selection:
 * * Distinct paths with low link latency
 *
 * Operator Placement:
 * * Non-blocking operators closer to source
 * * Replicate operators when possible
