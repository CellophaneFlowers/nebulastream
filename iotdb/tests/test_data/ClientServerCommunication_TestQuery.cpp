Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
    the speed of noncritical parts of their programs,
    and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and
            maintenance are considered.We should forget about small efficiencies,
    say about 97 %
        of the time
    : premature optimization is the root of all evil.Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3 %
            .
