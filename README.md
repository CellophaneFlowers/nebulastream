# NebulaStream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nebulastream/IoTDB.svg?token=ucXZaks2p5zNzXrQWU11&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nebulastream/IoTDB)

Our awesome new IoT data stream management system :-)

New working mode starting from February on
  - Monday: review issues and agree on issues that can be solved in one week
  - Wednesday/End of week: prepare a pull request for the change
  - If a task is to large or finished early => reschedule accordingly
  
Working with the repository:
  - Create a feature-branch when you start working on an issue
  - Note down the branch in the issue
  - Maintain the current status in the issue (e.g. if a step is finished or the the working day ends)
  - Create a pull request when finished
